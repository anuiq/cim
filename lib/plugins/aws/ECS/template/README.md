# AWS EC2 Container Service
Creates the ECS cluster and ALB.  

Services are deployed into private subnets and the ALB is deployed into public subnets.

A custom domain name and SSL are optional.

See the [Services Stack](https://github.com/thestackshack/services-stack) example to see how the VPC, ECR, ECS, and this Service example all fit together.
